# Computer-Vision-Custom-Object-Detector

## INTROCUCTION
In this project proposed and trained a
MobileNet neural network which is a lightweight DNNs performs
the detection of various objects like (mouse, monitor, keyboard
and CPU) in real-time by building the custom object detector and
converting it into onnx format to be reusable in any application
with using ZED mini performs with good accuracy.

More details and results on the Project.pdf file.
